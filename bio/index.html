        <p>
          Born and raised in Madrid, Spain. Have been always interested in
          creative ways to express ideas and concepts. he started to draw and
          attend painting lessons from childhood at the same time that his
          father taught him some electronic skills soldering circuits to make
          random dices, automatized switches. But I guess creative procedures
          are the only ones he could follow using imagination and intuition to
          reflex about his context, in a art and experimental way. <br />He
          developed his skills of drawing and painting, but his favourite
          discipline was always contemporary sculpture . After some years in the
          university he realized about sculpture possibilities and new ways of
          expanding the three-dimensional conceptualization, as also his first
          introduction to site-specific installations, performances and
          happenings took place. <br />He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts
          from the University of Granada, Spain. Where he lived for three years
          combined with one year of exchange in the Aristotle University of
          Thessaloniki, Greece in 2012.<br />
          <br />In between his university studies he spent in Venezuela a year,
          in which he studied in a Master Chef School, work in gastronomical
          field and had very satisfactory experiences after achieving some
          knowledge that was developed in Comuna con la Cocina project, in which
          it was a food happening based on pre-Marxists theories of the commune.
          This project is a key factor in his perspective of how art changed
          since then to a more critical and participative way.
          <br />
          <br />
          All experiences he had from the places he lived inspired him in art
          and critical motivations, in such a way that he don't differ from one
          apart from the other. His focus then is on community works and
          interactive installations where the people can participate and get
          involved to, in the end his works could be integrated systems to
          satisfy community needs in a creative way.<br />
          <br />
          He spent another year in Venezuela having the opportunity to work with
          some of the art infrastructures of Caracas, such as a gallery, a
          cultural park, and the National Gallery. Also he has been very
          connected to the new experimental university of arts. With these
          experiences he realized about how important are finding new paths to
          connect with institutions to develop more accurate ways of art to
          connect with society and how this interpolate day-to-day life.
          <br />Currently I am studying in the University of Art and Design
          Linz, the Master program of Interface Cultures in the Austrian city of
          Linz.
          <br />
          <br />
          His focus in art is based on the belief that new ways of alternative
          lifestyle is possible, where he include his work of art and politics
          as possible solutions to achieve a better culture. He commit to this
          purpose experimenting through art. critical thinking, philosophy,
          politics and social concepts that ping in the direction of the matter
          of life. <br />
