        <br />Born and raised in Madrid, Spain. Have been always interested in
        creative ways to express ideas and concepts. he started to draw and
        attend painting lessons from childhood at the same time that his father
        taught him some electronic skills soldering circuits to make random
        dices, automatized switches. But I guess creative procedures are the
        only ones he could follow using imagination and intuition to reflex
        about his context, in a art and experimental way. <br />He developed his
        skills of drawing and painting, but his favourite discipline was always
        contemporary sculpture . After some years in the university he realized
        about sculpture possibilities and new ways of expanding the
        three-dimensional conceptualization, as also his first introduction to
        site-specific installations, performances and happenings took place.
        <br />He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of
        Granada, Spain. Where he lived for three years combined with one year of
        exchange in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece in 2012.<br />
        <br />In between his university studies he spent in Venezuela a year, in
        which he studied in a Master Chef School, work in gastronomical field
        and had very satisfactory experiences after achieving some knowledge
        that was developed in Comuna con la Cocina project, in which it was a
        food happening based on pre-Marxists theories of the commune. This
        project is a key factor in his perspective of how art changed since then
        to a more critical and participative way.
        <br />
        <br />
        All experiences he had from the places he lived inspired him in art and
        critical motivations, in such a way that he don't differ from one apart
        from the other. His focus then is on community works and interactive
        installations where the people can participate and get involved to, in
        the end his works could be integrated systems to satisfy community needs
        in a creative way.<br />
        <br />
        He spent another year in Venezuela having the opportunity to work with
        some of the art infrastructures of Caracas, such as a gallery, a
        cultural park, and the National Gallery. Also he has been very connected
        to the new experimental university of arts. With these experiences he
        realized about how important are finding new paths to connect with
        institutions to develop more accurate ways of art to connect with
        society and how this interpolate day-to-day life.
        <br />Currently I am studying in the University of Art and Design Linz,
        the Master program of Interface Cultures in the Austrian city of Linz.
        <br />
        <br />
        His focus in art is based on the belief that new ways of alternative
        lifestyle is possible, where he include his work of art and politics as
        possible solutions to achieve a better culture. He commit to this
        purpose experimenting through art. critical thinking, philosophy,
        politics and social concepts that ping in the direction of the matter of
        life. <br />
