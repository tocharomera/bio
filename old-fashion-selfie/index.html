      <h1>Old fashion selfie</h1>
      <h2>Concept</h2>
      For Peter Weibel the boundaries of the world are the boundaries of our
      interfaces do. We do not interact with the world, only with the interface
      to the world and Maps are interfaces between humans and the World. As
      inhabitant in it, we only can observe it from inside.<br />
      Old fashion selfie is a photography map, it gives pixels pieces of
      information to navigate images counteracting the fast consumption of an
      image.
      <h2>Tech</h2>
      It’s a device thought to be obsolete and still be functional, thanks to
      E-ink when the battery would be over, if no recharge, the image will still
      be present. The pictures shown in old fashion selfie are encrypted in
      layered, split tiles. Filtered images present information with different
      levels of pixelation, which are related to the zoom of the image. Only on
      the last level of the image, we can appreciate the original pixels of the
      images and all the tiny details kept on them.
      <h2>Context</h2>
      As maps work, the first impression just gives us hint of what is contained
      in the following images, the more detailed information we want to receive,
      the “closer” we have to augment, therefore reducing the proportional scale
      of the represented territory. Snapshots are treated as maps, processing
      information not by only augmenting the scale of the images, but creating
      abstractions of the subject using the bricks that build digital images.
      They depict every gesture as a mountain and every line as river, making
      the imagination to work as when looking at a very old picture, trying to
      guess what is the story behind every detail, making a journey through the
      image as a walking trip, slowly travelling through territory accidentals.
      The represented subject intimacy is protected with this kind of
      encryption. Only the human mind can put together and reproduce the whole
      picture mentally. Everything seen shows special but at the same time, very
      similar to the standards our vocabulary can describe. When a face is
      represented, we can appreciate the similarities with other equals, two
      eyes, one nose, mouth and chin. If for Viléms Flusser´s photography was
      capturing the passing river aka time, todays selfies symbolizes the
      pressured water torrent each person leaks into the social networks
      frameworks. The consumerism of media, polemic trends like Facebook which
      will at some point or another will involve us point to make photography
      and video obsolete in favor of more immersive media such as the
      combination of both previous mediums together with physical gestures
      embodiment. How do we look at pictures nowadays and how generations prior
      to us used to look at them has significantly changed. Its impossible to
      measure how much attention people were putting into pictures when
      photography was invented. If we would compare it with today’s scrolling
      media consumption, we can figure out what is the difference we are talking
      about. What is the problem of looking at pictures so fast? Everything must
      be catchy, then pixel perfection is required(smiles, faces, bodies,
      landscapes) and we have to produce massive of this content to feed the
      social machinery that keep us feeling connected to other peoples through
      mainly, screens. Artificial scarcity works as the artistic principle,
      creating a gamification of the glance over the different levels, realizing
      about the simplicity of the logic that keep our brain interested and
      realizing how we look at images in our everyday life.
