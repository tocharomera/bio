    <br /> Born and raised in Madrid, Spain. I have been always interested in creative ways to express ideas and concepts. I started to draw and attend painting lessons from childhood at the same time my father taught me some electronic skills soldering
    circuits to make random dices, automatised switches. I guess artistic procedures are the only ones I could follow using my imagination to reflex about my context, in a intuitive and experimental way. <br /> I developed my skills of drawing and painting,
    but my favourite discipline was always sculpture. After some years in the university I realized about sculpture possibilities and new ways of expanding the three-dimensional conceptualization, as also my first introduction to site-specific installations,
    performances and happennings took place.<br /> Finally I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Granada, Spain. Where I lived for three years combined with one year of exchange in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2012.<br
    />
    <br /> In between my university studies I spent in Venezuela a year, in which I studied in a Master Chef School, work in gastronomical field and had very satisfactory expieriences after achieving some knowledge that was develop in Comuna con la
    Cocina project with university colleague Martina Marqués Fedelich in which we prepare a food happening based on pre-marxists theories of the comune. This project is a key in my perspective of art that changed since then to a more critical and participative
    way. <br />
    <br /> All experiences I had from the places I lived inspired me in a political and artistic in such a way that I don't differ from one appart from the other. My focus then is on community works and interactive installations where the people can
    participate and get involved to in the end could work as integrated systems to satisfy community needs in a creative way.<br /> I spent another year in Venezuela having the opportunity to work with some of the art infraestructures of Caracas, such
    as a gallery, a cultural park, and a museum. Also being very connected to the new experimental university of arts. With these experiences I realised about how important are finding new structures to develop more accurated ways of creativity and
    how this interpolate life.<br />
    <br /> Currently I am studying in the Polytechnic University of Valencia visual arts and multimedia with a exchange year within the Master of Interface Cultures in the Austrian city of Linz. <br />
    <br /> My focus in art is based on the belief that new ways of structure life, where I include from my work art and politics are required to achieve a sustainable culture. I commit myself to this purpose experimenting through art with philoshophic
    concepts that pint in the direction of the matter. <br />
